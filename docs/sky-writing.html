      <h1>What is this?</h1>
      <p>
        This is a new take on the demos I've created in
        <a href="./letters.html">./letters.html</a>. The user can type any text
        he wants, including line breaks. And I will display the words as sky
        writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really like the sky writing effect and I want to do a better job of
        that. Presumably I can add other effects, too, chosen from a radio
        button.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea is that a "normal" person could use this. Presumably you could
        write a message, customize it, then send someone a url to view it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a work in progress. I'm refactoring code so ./letters.html and
        this page can share more code. At this point I can switch between
        different animation styles and configure the animation from the GUI. I
        need to fix some small bugs in the Handwriting demo, but it's a pretty
        good proof of concept. And I need to port more demos to this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm still focused on skywriting. "Handwriting" is an important step
        along the way. I'm pretty happy with with this animation. I'll probably
        tweak it, but for now it looks great.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm just getting started on the "rough" stuff. I used rough.js on
        <a href="./letters.html">./letters.html</a>. That was good enough for a
        prototype, but I've clearly pushed it as far as I can. On this page I'm
        making things "rough" with my own code. This is a promising start. I've
        got a lot of cleanup to do, but the basic idea is in place and looks
        good.
