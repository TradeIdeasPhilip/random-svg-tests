      The hue changes in the x direction. The value or lightness changes in the
      y direction. In every spot I chose the color with the largest possible
      saturation.

      The top one is all my work. The bottom on comes from a third party
      library.

      I like my work but I think it still has room for improvement. The primary
      colors are all thin lines, especially the
      <span style="color: blue">blue</span>. Things turn cyan or magenta
      <i>so</i> quickly, and those secondary colors are
      <i>way</i> overrepresented.
