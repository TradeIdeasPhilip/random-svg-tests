# Random SVG Tests

I'm having fun.
It's nice to have a place to doodle.

## Quick Simple Fun JavaScript Animations

This video will show you my initial progress:

Since then I've added a [simple physics engine](https://github.com/TradeIdeasPhilip/random-svg-tests/commit/7edfc00b4d33ed860063ceae97172ab9438529f1).
The physics works, but my [first attempt at goal seeking](https://github.com/TradeIdeasPhilip/random-svg-tests/blob/7edfc00b4d33ed860063ceae97172ab9438529f1/src/main.ts#L677) is better at orbiting a goal than actually touching it.
