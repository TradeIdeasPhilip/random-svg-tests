      <h1>Zoomed In</h1>
      <p>
        Click on one of the letters above to see more details about that letter.
        (Currently this only works for the <i>rough</i> option.) You can see
        some results below. You can see additional information in the console.
        And this automatically copies information that you can paste into
        <a href="./path-debugger.html">./path-debugger.html</a> for even more
        options.
      </p>
      <h2>After</h2>
      <p>
        This is the item you clicked on <i>after</i> it was made completely
        rough.
      </p>
      <div id="debuggerAfter"></div>
      <h2>Before</h2>
      <p>
        This is the item you clicked on after minimal processing. It should look
        just like the original to the end user. However, it will typically
        convert all commands to Q commands and split some commands into smaller
        pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to morph between <i>normal</i> and <i>rough</i> options,
        start from this, not the original.
      </p>
      <div id="debuggerBefore"></div>
      <h1>What is this?</h1>
      <p>
        This is a new take on the demos I've created in
        <a href="./letters.html">./letters.html</a>. The user can type any text
        he wants, including line breaks. And I will display the words as sky
        writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really like the sky writing effect and I want to do a better job of
        that. Presumably I can add other effects, too, chosen from a radio
        button.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea is that a "normal" person could use this. Presumably you could
        write a message, customize it, then send someone a url to view it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a work in progress. I'm refactoring code so ./letters.html and
        this page can share more code. At this point I can switch between
        different animation styles and configure the animation from the GUI. I
        need to fix some small bugs in the Handwriting demo, but it's a pretty
        good proof of concept. And I need to port more demos to this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm still focused on skywriting. "Handwriting" is an important step
        along the way. I'm pretty happy with with this animation. I'll probably
        tweak it, but for now it looks great.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm just getting started on the "rough" stuff. I used rough.js on
        <a href="./letters.html">./letters.html</a>. That was good enough for a
        prototype, but I've clearly pushed it as far as I can. On this page I'm
        making things "rough" with my own code. This is a promising start. I've
        got a lot of cleanup to do, but the basic idea is in place and looks
        good.
