/**
 * This test shows how you can use noise similar to fourier-smackdown,
 * but without using a canvas.
 *
 * I'm drawing an animated pattern very similar to the one in fourier-smackdown,
 * (I need to make them even closer, for a fair comparison.  TODO)
 * I'm paying more attention to the process to minimize the round-off errors.
 * The idea is that a single matrix multiply to put the noise into range is probably reasonable.
 * It seems promising, but not certain, to bring improvements.
 *
 * I've also added some partial transparency using the `opacity` property.
 * The black line shows what happens when I use opacity on top of this changing background.
 * The middle background rectangle has the background noise and is partially transparent itself.
 * The idea is that the opacity is not subject to the same limitations as svg filters are,
 * and they are generally robust and easy to work with.
 *
 * It's hard to say much from the transparency test so far.
 * It appears that things are changing very smoothly and without incident.
 * I probably wouldn't use this exact combination of effects.
 * The idea is maybe to have multiple rectangles with with their own effects.
 * Each rectangle is filled with some noise like effect, very possibly frozen in time.
 * But then I can merge two or more using opacity, where the exact opacity changes over time.
 * Maybe make a few key-frames, like the most extreme red, green or blue versions of the noise,
 * Then use transparency to interpolate between them.
 * This could make it easy to move from the primary colors theme to selected colors.
 *
 * The orange gradient background looks great,
 * but is far too subtle to mean anything in this context.
