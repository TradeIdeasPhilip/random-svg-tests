/**
 * TODO
 * Try turning the straight lines into curves.
 * For every adjacent pair of segments, check angleBetween(previous.outgoingAngle, incomingAngle)
 * If it is <= 90Â° assume it should be flattened.
 * Take a smart average between to the two angles.
 * const angleMid = angleA + angleBetween(angleA, angleB) / 2;
 * That was copied from path-debugger.ts
 * path-debugger.ts is moving points and fixing angles, we're just fixing angles here.
 * Replace every segment with the same coordinates but the new angles.
 * 
 * What if a segment won't comply?
 * Look at the lower case h in cursive.  
 * Look at where is makes an s shape (but rotated and flipped).
 * There is a straight part in the middle of the change in curvature.
 * I bet it fails there.
 * Probably lots of places where there's a change in curvature in that font.
 * 
 * First, revert the broken Q to an L.
 * Second, try to change the adjacent items to compensate.
 * Instead of moving the adjacent Q to the average angle, move it all the way to the L's angle to create a smooth connection.
 * If the adjacent segment is already an L, don't do anything.
 * If the adjacent segment was working with the average, but not working when it has to go all the way,
 *   leave it in place with the half way.
 *   Then it will still have a correct curve on the other end.
 *   And it won't cause a cascade on the other end.
 *   The the broken end will still be closer to perfect than the original line was.
 *   I don't expect this to happen a lot, so hard to test, so keep a simple solution, do nothing.
 * 
 * Do it in the loop immediately above.  First do the cursive letter with the cursive font info.
 * Then do the curvy cursive letter with the unmodified cursive font info.
 * Then the same two things for the other font.
 * 4 across where it was 2 across.
